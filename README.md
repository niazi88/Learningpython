# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a simple command-line **Number Guessing Game** built in Python.  
You can choose a difficulty level and try to guess a random number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game picks a **random number** between 1 and 100.
- You choose a **difficulty level**:  
  - `easy` → 10 attempts  
  - `hard` → 5 attempts
- You keep guessing the number until you:
  - Find the correct number 🎉
  - Or run out of attempts ❌

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. This game uses a custom logo. Place the `art.py` file (or logo variable) in the same folder.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
````

---

## 📁 Files Required

* `number_guessing_game.py` – main game script
* `art.py` – contains the `logo` used for display (optional for fun)

---

## 🛠️ Features

* Difficulty levels
* Feedback for each guess (Too High / Too Low)
* Limited attempts based on difficulty
* Clear win/loss messages

---

## 🚀 Learning Goals

This project helps in learning:

* `random` module
* `input()` handling
* `if-else` conditions
* Loops and control flow
* List usage (for mutable single-value tracking)
